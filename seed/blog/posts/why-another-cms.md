# Why another CMS?

Using different CMS system on projects varying from heavy weights like Teamsite, Drupal and lightweights like Wordpress or rails based Radiant or LocomotiveCMS. I aways found problems with all these CMS systems is, I had to code my application logic in the way CMS system outlines either as plugins or modules etc.

Why CMS system can't be unobtrusive. Means I want all features of CMS and allows me to code & evolve my application logic as I want. e.g. I have rails application and would like to add CMS as component in it. I can upgrade my rails app without any problem. I faced similar problem, using Radiant CMS with rails 2, 3.2 and 4 all versions.

Also it is difficult to consume data from different or in-house sources. Such as, already have product catalog api available and would like to use it.
